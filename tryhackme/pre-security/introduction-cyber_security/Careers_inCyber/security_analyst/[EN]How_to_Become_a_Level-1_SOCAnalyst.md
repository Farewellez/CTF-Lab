## What is a SOC Analyst

A SOC Analyst works within a Security Operations Center — a centralized unit that deals with security issues on an organizational and technical level. The SOC team monitors, detects, investigates, and responds to cyber threats around the clock.

SOC Analysts use a combination of technology tools, threat intelligence, and hands-on investigation to defend against cyber attacks and prevent potential breaches.


## SOC Analyst Level 1 Roles and Responsibilities

A Level 1 SOC Analyst (also called Tier 1) is the first line of defense in the SOC structure. They act as triage specialists, continuously monitoring systems and filtering real threats from false positives.
