A career as a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst offers significant rewards, challenges, and opportunities for growth. It’s a dynamic role where no two days are the same. SOC Analysts serve as the frontline defenders against cyber threats, ensuring the protection of an organization's data, infrastructure, and digital operations. This article shares insights into the daily responsibilities of SOC Analysts, featuring real-world experience from Isaiah, a former in-house SOC Analyst and current TryHackMe Content Engineer and Senior Offensive Security Engineer.

## What Does a Day in the Life of a SOC Analyst Look Like?

A typical day for a SOC Analyst begins by reviewing the dashboards of various monitoring tools. These dashboards show logs and alerts that help detect unusual or suspicious activities within a network.

### Daily Responsibilities:

* **Investigating Alerts**: SOC Analysts review triggered alerts, examining logs and event data to determine if they are real threats or false positives.
* **Filtering Noise**: Many alerts turn out to be false positives. Analysts tune detection rules to reduce unnecessary alerts and avoid alert fatigue.
* **Reporting**: Analysts document their findings and actions taken, and if their shift ends with ongoing investigations, they pass this information to the next team.

A crucial goal is maintaining a clear dashboard by the end of a shift or ensuring an organized handover for continuity.

## What Happens When You Identify an Alert?

When an alert is triggered, a SOC Analyst:

1. Identifies the **source, trigger, and reason** behind the alert.
2. Follows the company’s **incident response playbook** to determine next steps.
3. Performs **data correlation** from different tools like SIEM, EDR, web proxies, and endpoints.
4. **Builds a timeline** of the events to understand if the alert is legitimate or a false positive.

### If the alert is a false positive:

* Detection rules are refined.
* Documentation is updated to avoid the same mistake.

### If the alert is a true positive:

* Analysts engage relevant stakeholders.
* Incident response procedures are initiated.
* Actions like blocking IPs, isolating systems, or mitigating phishing are performed.


## Real-World Responsibilities from Isaiah's Experience

Isaiah has worked both in-house and at a Managed Security Services Provider (MSSP). His responsibilities included:

* Monitoring dashboards and consoles for signs of malware, hacking, or suspicious activity.
* Investigating user-submitted tickets for spam, phishing, or malware.
* Researching current cybersecurity trends and threats daily.
* Writing and tuning internal scripts to improve monitoring efficiency.
* Correlating device logs and triaging alerts.
* Initiating incident response protocols during security breaches.
* Performing threat hunting and anomaly detection.
* Writing threat intelligence reports on detected malware and attack techniques.


## How Real-World Experience Translates to TryHackMe Training

Isaiah’s hands-on SOC Analyst experience helps him design TryHackMe rooms with real-world relevance. These rooms simulate actual SOC environments, helping learners develop practical, job-ready skills.


## Advice for Aspiring SOC Analysts

Isaiah offers the following advice to those considering a SOC career:

* **Stay Curious**: Always adopt a mindset of “I may not know now, but I will learn.”
* **Hands-On Practice**: Validate what you read by applying it. Set up home labs, configure VMs, experiment with SIEM tools, and simulate attacks and defenses.
* **Embrace Humility**: Be open to being wrong and continuously adapt based on new information.
* **Master the Fundamentals**: Use learning paths like Cyber Security 101 to build foundational knowledge.
* **Engage with the Community**: Follow blogs, read bug bounty reports, explore threat intelligence posts.
* **Develop a Dual Perspective**: Think like both a defender and an attacker.


## TryHackMe Resources to Get Started

* **Cyber Security 101 Pathway**: A beginner-friendly route for mastering the basics.
* **SOC Level 1 Pathway**: Offers hands-on experience with alerts, tools, and incident handling.
* **SOC Level 2 Pathway**: A more advanced path covering threat hunting, malware analysis, and proactive defense.


## Conclusion

Being a SOC Analyst is not only a critical role but also a gateway to other positions in cybersecurity. Whether you want to advance into offensive security, threat intelligence, or management, SOC experience builds a solid foundation. With curiosity, practice, and the right resources, you can thrive in this dynamic and rewarding field.
