# Becoming a Cyber Security Analyst

## Overview

Becoming a Cyber Security Analyst involves acquiring a blend of technical skills, situational awareness, and an understanding of security tools and processes. The role typically sits within a Security Operations Centre (SOC) and focuses on monitoring, detecting, analyzing, and responding to security incidents to protect an organization's digital infrastructure.


## Responsibilities of a Cyber Security Analyst

### 1. **Security Monitoring and Incident Analysis**

* Monitor security alerts and events from various security tools (e.g., SIEM, EDR).
* Analyze and investigate alerts to determine the scope, impact, and remediation actions.
* Collaborate with senior analysts for escalations.
* Perform real-time log and network traffic analysis to identify vulnerabilities.

### 2. **Incident Response and Documentation**

* Document incidents clearly and accurately.
* Utilize tools for detection and investigation (e.g., IDS/IPS, log analysis tools).
* Conduct root cause analysis and recommend prevention strategies.
* Maintain updated documentation such as playbooks and SOPs.
* Communicate findings to internal teams.

### 3. **Threat Intelligence and Research**

* Stay current on emerging threats and attack vectors.
* Use threat intel to enhance detection and SOC performance.
* Support policy development with emerging threat data.

### 4. **Continuous Improvement**

* Participate in training to build technical expertise.
* Suggest improvements to existing security controls.
* Collaborate on refining detection rules and procedures.


## Required Skills and Tools

### Technical Skills

* Understanding of networking: TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP, firewall logs.
* Familiarity with SIEM tools (e.g., Splunk, Qradar).
* Experience with Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems.
* Ability to analyze logs and correlate events.
* Knowledge of incident response lifecycle.

### Certifications (Entry-Level)

* CompTIA Security+
* CompTIA CySA+
* (Nice to have) CEH, GSEC, or other foundational security certs.

### Soft Skills

* Analytical thinking and problem-solving mindset.
* Ability to prioritize tasks under pressure.
* Effective communication with both technical and non-technical teams.

## Real-World Considerations

### Working Conditions

* Many SOCs operate 24/7, requiring shift work or regional coverage.
* Rotations may vary weekly or monthly depending on organization.

### Research Before Applying

* Look into the organization's SOC maturity and tech stack (SIEM, SOAR, EDR).
* Understand how much visibility the SOC has — incomplete visibility hinders effectiveness.


## Commonly Used Tools & Frameworks

* **SIEM** (Security Information and Event Management): Splunk, ELK Stack, IBM Qradar
* **SOAR** (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response): Cortex XSOAR, Splunk SOAR
* **EDR**: CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, Microsoft Defender
* **Frameworks**: MITRE ATT\&CK, Cyber Kill Chain


## Clarifications & Myths

### Myth: "Security Analyst just stares at a dashboard."

* **Reality**: Analysts are involved in deep investigation, false-positive analysis, tuning detection logic, and coordinating incident responses.

### Myth: "Security Analyst jobs will vanish due to automation."

* **Reality**: Automation enhances efficiency but human analysis remains crucial for contextual judgment and advanced threat handling.

### Myth: "Most SOC analysts are women, while men are the real hackers."

* **Reality**: Gender does not determine capability. While the field may currently have demographic imbalances, skill is determined by dedication, curiosity, and continuous learning.


## Path to Become a Cyber Security Analyst

1. **Start with Fundamentals**

   * Learn basic networking and OS concepts.
   * TryHackMe paths: Pre-Security or Cyber Security 101.

2. **Progress to SOC Training**

   * Enroll in SOC Level 1 and 2 learning paths on TryHackMe.
   * Learn modules like:

     * Cyber Threat Intelligence
     * Network Security & Traffic Analysis
     * Log Analysis
     * Threat Hunting
     * Incident Response

3. **Build a Portfolio**

   * Document hands-on labs and exercises.
   * Join Capture The Flag (CTF) events.
   * Contribute to GitHub or personal blog with analysis reports.

4. **Prepare for Job Applications**

   * Look for roles that match your readiness and interests.
   * Research companies and their SOC environments.
   * Prepare for interviews with both technical and behavioral questions.


## Interview Advice

* Understand the goal of a SOC: minimize risk, provide visibility, and respond effectively.
* Be ready to talk through a sample incident or how you’d respond to a hypothetical attack.
* Reflect on collaboration and communication — SOC is a team effort.


## Final Thoughts

Cyber Security Analyst is a foundational blue team role that offers significant impact and learning opportunities. Whether you're drawn to this role long-term or using it as a stepping stone to red teaming or threat hunting, mastering the fundamentals and understanding the full SOC ecosystem will give you the edge.
